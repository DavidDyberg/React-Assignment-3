    <p class="description">In this project I have created a countdown timer for the launch of a Nasa satelite. The name of the mission is called Psyche and the targeted date for launch is October 10, 2023. Read the description from Nasa's official website below:</p>
    <p class="mission-description">Set to launch from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, Psyche will travel across the solar system to an asteroid of the same name, which has unusually high metal content. Scientists hope understand why this is so, and to help answer fundamental questions about Earthâ€™s own metal core and the formation of our solar system.</p>
